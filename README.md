# Lindenmayer Drawing

"""
This program uses the JavaFX API to create a Lindenmayer drawing.

From Wikipedia: An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.

A user defines an initial angle, initial starting point, starting string, and set of transformation rules and when the user hits "Enter", the
system is drawn on the canvas.
